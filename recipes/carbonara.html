     <h1>Carbonara</h1>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Oil: This traditional Italian recipe starts with olive oil.  </li>
        <li>Guanciale: Buy guanciale (or cured pork cheek) at your local butcher. If you canâ€™t find it, you can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta.</li>
        <li>Spaghetti: Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti noodles. If you like, you can substitute bucatini for the spaghetti. </li>
        <li>Eggs: Three large eggs add richness and flavor. </li>
        <li>Cheese: Opt for hand-shredded Pecorino Romano cheese. You can substitute Parmesan, if preferred.</li>

     </ul>
